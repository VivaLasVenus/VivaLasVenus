## Contributing with Viva Las Venus

We are very glad and honored that you decided to contribute with Viva Las Venus.  Your collaboration is essential to keep the project alive.

We are building a contributors' community with different skills to help to document and share knowledge.

> **Contributions are always welcome, all shared knowledge is growth!**

Viva Las Venus is still a baby. To grow strong with a amazing community, we need your contribution. It’s okay if you do not understand much or nothing about security and privacy, you can collaborate in many different ways and also, learn and have fun (**this is quite important!**)

* **Publicizing Viva Las Venus:** 
Spread the news! Tell for your friends, at college, school, work…. the more people interested in contributing and/or learning, the better!

* **Logo/ Visual Communication:** 
Do you have design skills? It would be awesome to have a beautiful design for social media, workshop/talks material and website

* **Website development:**
Right now, everything is only on our GitHub. We know this is not easiest platform to use, especially if you’re new to GitHub, so it would be great to have all information on a website

* **Translation/ Localization:** 
In order to be global, having content written only in Portuguese, the language I speak, is not enough. Corrections in the translations are very welcome! Also, you can contribute by translating to other languages.

* **Links, tools, material:** 
In wiki section of our GitHub, there is a list of cool links, tips and guides. Do you know more cool stuff on security and privacy? Please, share with us!

* **Teaching and material development:** 
Are you a researcher? Professor? Hacktivist? Student? Or do you have teaching material development skills and/or open curriculum\* in privacy & security? Your help is very valuable and noble. Join us!
